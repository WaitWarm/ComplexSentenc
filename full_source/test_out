and one day in Los Angeles , Steve , was hearing a beautiful opera landscape in Los Angeles .
a man who &apos;s played a violin string with a six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ half @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ vis @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ vis @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ vis @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ vis @-@ a @-@ a @-@ vis @-@
now , I know Steve Wozniak famously said that he had been trained for a long time in his career , and I know that many of you have been trained for a long time in his career , and he &apos;s now
after 30 years , he had a homeless asylum in Los Angeles , and he had a homeless asylum on the streets .
and I &apos;m going to encourage you to go and look at the two of the most powerful tools , and I &apos;m going to encourage you to go to the end of the film , not just to look at the
I was two years ago in 2008 in 2008 in 2008 two years ago .
and the first one was that he was listening to the symphony of the Beethoven .
and he said that the fourth act of the world was probably because he was so happy to speak to the World War II , and he started talking about the World War II .
and a few days later , I had a little bit of interest in my music , and I told Steve that I had a little bit of music .
and I thought that he was going to be an incurable optimist because he was going to be treated with his life , and he was supposed to be treated with the ink in his life .
now , a few days later , he was one of the worst fears of schizophrenia , and the worst kind of grace in his mind , and the fear that he was going to be the most vulnerable man on the street corner , and he
and the next thing we did was that he was in a space where he had lost his condition , and he started to walk in the hall .
he talked about his death and his death penalty bed for him .
and I was worried that if I wasn &apos;t afraid that I was going to be worried about him , I would argue that he was going to be in a form of other forms of the form of a form of a form that I would be worried about .
and so I started to stand up .
the first thing I did was I had a violin play Beethoven .
and when I knew that there was a change in my eye .
and I was like playing with him , and I was trying to figure out what was going on .
and he was curious , curious , curious , curious , curious , curious , curious , vivid and quiet and wonder .
and he started playing with his violin , and he started playing with some magic tricks , and he starts playing with some fantastic music .
and so we started talking about music , and we started talking about music , and we started talking about all the names of the names of the dots , and we started talking about music .
and I realized that he would be able to connect to a musical musician &apos;s music .
and he was talking to me about the music that I was talking to about in Los Angeles , the music , the music of the music , the music , the music of the music , the music , the music , the music of the music , the music , the music , the music , the music of the music , the music , the music , the music , the music , the music of the music , the music , the music , the music , the music , the music , the music that
and I talked about this music in Los Angeles listening to music in Los Angeles Philharmonic playing music by having a wonderful musician on the streets of music in Los Angeles Philharmonic playing music by having a musician on the streets of music .
music is a change .
and for him , the music was a translation for him .
because he &apos;s going to be able to turn the musical imagination through his imagination and through his imagination and through his imagination and through his imagination and through his imagination .
and that &apos;s what helped him do .
and I know that &apos;s art .
and that is the essence of our emotional limitations , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our deepest emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through our emotions , through
and that gives us a sense of what we do , and that gives us a sense of unity .
and he took a bunch of friends into his music .
and he &apos;s going to take his music to his family , and he &apos;s going to take his understanding of his music .
and I &apos;m going to be able to create a musician on the street , because I &apos;m going to be able to do whatever he &apos;s doing .
thank you .
TM : thank you . thank you .
Robert Full .
and I &apos;m going to show you a piece of music that I &apos;m going to play with .
so I just wanted to do that .
I &apos;ve had a lot of fish in my life .
I love two of my favorites .
the first is passion , passion .
it &apos;s the most popular fish , and it &apos;s the most beautiful , most popular fish in the most popular fish .
how beautiful .
it &apos;s a better standard . it &apos;s the highest standard .
and he &apos;s going to sell his shoes .
and I spent about a few months in this beautiful relationship .
and one day , I was invited to call sustainability , and I got a call from sustainability in sustainability .
and I said , &quot; Sure , of course .
what &apos;s going to be a good restaurant that we &apos;re trying to put on the fish that we &apos;re trying to keep the fish out there .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been collecting the fish from the sea .
it &apos;s not something that is valuable .
and we &apos;ve got 30 percent of all the big fish , and they &apos;ve got 90 percent of the big fish , and they &apos;ve got 90 percent of the big fish .
there &apos;s almost no left .
so whether it &apos;s good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad , we will be part of the future .
and there &apos;s a lot of things about this industry , and they &apos;re very efficient , and they &apos;re going to be the biggest industry , and they &apos;re all very efficient , and they &apos;re very efficient .
it &apos;s 15 commodities .
and what I mean by this is that it &apos;s about 15 pounds of meat , and every 15 @-@ pound fish in this fish .
this is not sustainable .
and not good .
and finally , the company wants to do something .
I want to support them .
and at that point , I was in the day of the gang leader in the gang .
and let &apos;s call him a deep learning practitioner .
and I &apos;m not going to tell you , I &apos;m famous for the fact that I &apos;m famous for the sea , and I &apos;m not going to tell you that the ocean is a very famous for the sea .
and he said , &quot; We &apos;re not going to have a place where you &apos;re going to have a place where you &apos;re not going to have a place where you &apos;re not going to have a place where you &apos;re not going to have a place where you &apos;re not going to have a place where you &apos;re not going to have a place where it , and we &apos;re not going to have a place where it &apos;s going .
and then he picks up , and we add a little bit more credit .
and he said , &quot; It &apos;s two or three . &quot;
it &apos;s the best in the gang .
one , two or three .
what are you with ? one , two , one , two , three , five , two , five ?
and he said , &quot; Well , the proteins are sustainability .
and I said , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s great .
and I was thinking , &quot; What &apos;s going on in bed ? &quot;
so , the next day , I phoned the activities .
and I said , &quot; Are you an example of something that &apos;s sustainable ? &quot;
he would say he would go around .
and I didn &apos;t have a clear understanding of the answer , but I didn &apos;t have a clear understanding of the answer , and I didn &apos;t have a clear understanding of the answer .
and he made me call him a prototype .
I &apos;m going to talk about sustainability , and I can tell you a little bit about sustainability ?
and he talked about algae and he talked about some algae and he talked about .
and I said , &quot; Well , what ?
he said , &quot; It &apos;s a feathers , it &apos;s made up , it &apos;s the bone marrow , it &apos;s the bone marrow , it &apos;s the bone marrow .
and I said , &quot; How many of the chicken in the chicken ? &quot;
you know , two percent .
and he said , &quot; Well , maybe 30 percent .
and I said , &quot; What &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
and he said to me , &quot; There &apos;s a long time , and there &apos;s a lot of silence around the world .
and I didn &apos;t love this fish anymore .
I &apos;m not an optimist , because I &apos;m not a vegetarian .
and I was like this .
and I fell in love with this , and I swear to God because I fell in love with this fish .
second , it &apos;s a different kind of fish .
the more you know , the more you love it , the more you love it .
I was in the first place in the southern Spain , and I was in the southern Scotland .
a long time ago I had a reporter with a reporter .
and she said , &quot; Yes .
the white one was white , and the white fish were on the table .
it &apos;s time for cooking .
it &apos;s like cooking twice .
but it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s wonderful .
and who can do this kind of thing in a nice time ?
but I couldn &apos;t .
he &apos;s called the names of his name .
but he &apos;s not a chef . he &apos;s not a chef , and I don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t understand it .
he was a biologist in the stairwell .
he was a <unk> in Spain .
he was in the river of the river .
until the last century , until about 80 people in the 1990s .
and they were basically in the gang .
and they put water on the floor .
and then they put a whole series of water into the stream .
but I don &apos;t mean they &apos;re successful .
and it was a huge catastrophe .
and the birds in this region are all around the region , and the birds are almost everywhere .
in 1982 , a company of Spain realized that the Spanish government had built .
what do they do ?
and they did .
they &apos;re basically <unk> .
they &apos;re bringing water into this tube , and they &apos;re using it .
they fill out the water .
and then there &apos;s a whole gang leader -- this is a shrimp farm @-@ acre company , built @-@ acre @-@ acre @-@ acre @-@ acre @-@ acre @-@ acre company -- this time period .
this was amazing .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
and I &apos;m looking at the horizon , and you &apos;re looking at the horizon and you &apos;re looking at the horizon , and you &apos;re looking at the horizon , and you &apos;re looking at the horizon and the horizon .
and I &apos;ve been there for a long time , long ago .
he &apos;s an amazing man , and he &apos;s an amazing man .
and we went into the <unk> , and I talked about my knee replacement , and I talked about my knee .
he &apos;s got a rare , and he &apos;s got a rare black guy .
this is his need to be able to meet his needs .
and there &apos;s a group of people who see the same pattern .
and it took a long time in the park for a long time , and it was a long time in the park .
I asked him how to become a fish .
he said , &quot; I don &apos;t know the fish . &quot;
I &apos;m just a experts .
and then he started talking to him about algae , and he had a special conversation about the birds and the algae .
please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , not talk about that
but it was great for me .
I &apos;ve never seen a fish that &apos;s eaten by the dark side of my mouth .
and so I said , &quot; Well , what do you do with a fish ? &quot;
he &apos;s followed by algae .
and I knew that these things were amazing , and I knew that there was nothing left .
but what do you eat ?
how many eat ?
and he told me that this is a wild fish , and that &apos;s what they eat .
the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , are all the same .
it &apos;s totally self @-@ update , and it &apos;s self @-@ health .
there &apos;s nothing in there .
have you ever heard of a farm animal ?
and I was so successful , and I asked myself , how do you measure the nature of his farm like that day , and I asked him , &quot; How do you look like that ?
and suddenly , there was a film to change the film .
and what we &apos;re seeing here is one of the most beautiful pictures of the most beautiful , and the most beautiful sequence of pink .
he said , &quot; That was the success .
and they look at the pink eyes .
they &apos;re just enjoying the <unk> .
and I was completely wiped out .
and I said , &quot; No , do you have a fish in your fish ?
and he said , &quot; It &apos;s right .
20 percent of the fish we eat fish , 20 percent of the fish eat fish .
and last year , there are over 250 different species , and there are over 2,000 different species .
today , one of the biggest public goods in Europe has become one of the biggest public goods .
I don &apos;t want to say that birds don &apos;t want more ?
he &apos;s not very big .
and he said , &quot; No , we &apos;re not mutually exclusive .
this is a network .
these shrimp eat shrimp .
eat shrimp .
so the more attractive the system , the more the more the more it is , the more the more it is .
okay . so let &apos;s look at the animal that &apos;s measured its own farm , and it &apos;s a good measure of it .
and at the same time , birds are a bird .
and by the way , they &apos;re not supposed to be there .
and they &apos;re more productive than 150 miles of soil , and they &apos;re more fit in .
in the morning , they fly about 150 miles an hour .
at night , they flew home at 150 miles .
and they can do that because they can do that .
I &apos;m not kidding .
I was looking at my head and looking at my head and looking at things like this .
and I said , &quot; Well , do they fly back at night and they fly over 150 miles ? &quot;
are they doing this for children ?
and I just looked at him and I just looked at me and he looked at me and he looked at me .
and he said , &quot; No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , because they &apos;re not doing it .
I don &apos;t like the most beautiful , and I don &apos;t like them , and I don &apos;t like them . I don &apos;t like them .
it &apos;s got a taste , like that .
I never did it together .
but when I was in the northern part of the country , it didn &apos;t look like Spanish .
and the first thing is that it &apos;s just like you &apos;re in the ocean , and you &apos;re like a fish .
and I talked to him about his thoughts .
and he said , &quot; It &apos;s like a sponge ball .
and the final thing is that it &apos;s turning into the body .
it sucks . it sucks .
and he said , &quot; But we don &apos;t have water . &quot;
it &apos;s a good measure of a fish . it &apos;s not a good measure of a fish .
and he said that when I realized that there was no water coming from the river of the river , because there was no water coming from the river of the river .
now there &apos;s a river in the river of a river of a river of a river of a river of a river of a river of a river of a river of a river of a river .
and when the water goes into the water , it becomes more clean .
this is a water system . it &apos;s able to filter it .
so basically , I don &apos;t just measure it , but it &apos;s an animal that &apos;s a healthy animal that &apos;s a healthy animal , and it &apos;s basically just for you , and it &apos;s a healthy animal that doesn &apos;t just measure .
because when the Atlantic left the Atlantic , it would leave the Atlantic .
and I know that it &apos;s not just the same thing , but it &apos;s also true , because I know that you should be doing it .
you might say it &apos;s the future of the future , whether it &apos;s a wild or a dish .
now , what we need is a whole different conception of agriculture .
but for a lot of us , it &apos;s an extreme case .
we &apos;re not our loved ones . we &apos;re an idiot .
we &apos;re talking about organic farms . we love organic farms . we love organic farms .
but when you stand up and you say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be standing in the future and I &apos;m going to be standing up and I &apos;m going to love the future of the world , and I &apos;m going to love the future of the future .
how do you feel for the world ? &quot;
can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t like you .
because we don &apos;t need a world where we don &apos;t need food anymore .
a billion people are still in today .
it &apos;s not as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as it is -- it &apos;s a billion dollars a decade ago -- it &apos;s not about a decade ago .
and I didn &apos;t like because he didn &apos;t really think about food in the last 50 years .
and we asked , what would it be that if we could give more sugar more sugar more sugar , and then we could give it to farmers , and we could give them a simple way to the plant , and we could use it to feed fruit , and we could give it to farmers
it &apos;s a business plan . it &apos;s an agricultural project . it &apos;s a commercial .
we should point out that it should be an ecological footprint in an ecological footprint that &apos;s supposed to be an ecological asset .
it &apos;s not a business . it &apos;s not a business .
today , our food supply is not because of the food supply .
the latest technologies are not new ; the latest technologies , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the oceans , the water
what would the world want ?
let &apos;s start asking ourselves : how do we feed ourselves ?
how can we create a better environment , a better environment ?
now , let &apos;s not be a model of agriculture .
and it &apos;s obsolete . it &apos;s obsolete .
because it &apos;s not just organic , it &apos;s mechanical , and it &apos;s grown locally .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it has existed for 20 million years .
look at farmers like this . look at farmers .
they &apos;re not experts , they &apos;re not experts , they &apos;re just experts , they &apos;re not experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re not experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re not experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re not experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re not experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re experts , they &apos;re experts ,
because they &apos;re experts too .
and if I &apos;m a chef , they &apos;re better than I am .
and I know that if you think that the future of food is perfectly rational , because they &apos;re perfectly rational .
thank you .
and I want you to think about what we &apos;re seeing today , what we &apos;re seeing here today is the data that &apos;s going to be the data that we &apos;re going to be able to consume , and that &apos;s the data that &apos;s the data that &apos;s going to be
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical graph of a typical death rate .
I &apos;m here to use a little tool .
I could use it as an accident , for instance , for example , to filter it .
and I immediately saw a different pattern .
and this is because in the middle of the middle age , in the middle of the middle age , they &apos;re active .
and the reason we see this is that we &apos;re not going to die of cancer , but we can see that the primary prevention of death penalty disease is a disease of a disease .
if we look at the age of 40 , we can look at the age of 40 .
and if you look at this one of these two columns , you &apos;ll see that this works .
well , you can see , it &apos;s a great way of looking at this information , and you can look at the data that &apos;s going on .
why wouldn &apos;t we be able to do that ?
so what we &apos;re showing here is the cover of the cover of every book ever attempted .
all the Web is on the Web .
and you can just go back to the room .
you can look at 10 years from now .
you can see a year a year .
you can go into one degree .
for example , I used to see this glass ceiling .
and so I just showed it , and I just showed it all the questions I showed , and I just showed it just showed you .
now , if I look at all this data , I would like to show you how all this data could be ?
so I can step back and step back and step back .
now I saw Matthew Broderick .
so when you &apos;re looking at this information , you &apos;re not looking at it , you &apos;re looking at it , and you &apos;re looking at it , you &apos;re looking at it in a way , and you &apos;re looking at it , you &apos;re looking at it .
you &apos;re actually doing something different .
and the way we think that information is changing the way we use information .
so I &apos;m a little crazy , and I &apos;m a little crazy .
so here &apos;s a small page , and here &apos;s a small page , and here &apos;s what we do .
it &apos;s a very well @-@ known example of a professional psychic paper .
I just wanted to show 500 pages here .
but even in these things , we can browse these things .
we immediately knew what was the popular Wikipedia .
and I chose to move forward .
now , what I can see is that the third @-@ year @-@ olds in Wikipedia are one of the first five governments .
this is a very important source of content because it &apos;s a very important source of content .
and you can see that there &apos;s only a couple of them coming out of a few weeks .
and then I can look at some of them , and I can go into a special era .
so I &apos;m looking at some of these people from government , and I &apos;m looking at some of them , and I can see that there &apos;s a little bit of a government from government .
and that &apos;s a lot of fun at TED .
so we can look at all the big scream at TED .
so this is a page of the first time you see on the web , and it &apos;s not just a page , but it &apos;s a page .
so I want you to tell me one other thing .
I &apos;m just showing you the New York .
and I don &apos;t want to be a web browser like this , but I &apos;m going to give you a web browser , and I &apos;m going to give you a web browser that &apos;s a web browser .
so I can go back to a specific place .
and that &apos;s why I can browse the same way that I can browse through , because I can browse through all of the examples .
so I can go into the details .
in fact , here &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
and I can see that in some ways I can see something today .
and if I wanted to go back and search for something , I could look at Microsoft and search for something that I could do , I could look at Microsoft &apos;s history , and I could look at Microsoft Word , and I could look at it .
and I can just go into the Web , and I can go into these .
this is the same information that &apos;s been used every time , every time it uses more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information , more information than
now , in this world , we often talk about data .
we talk about the Big Bang .
we &apos;re talking about the oceans .
let &apos;s assume that the way we can see the link between the information and the way we can see the information , and we can &apos;t see the way we can see the information , and we can see the way we see the link between networks and the information and the
and if we can do that , if we can do that , it &apos;s not just the data , we can do that .
and it &apos;s not just information , but it &apos;s knowledge .
if we can get knowledge , we can find intelligence .
thank you .
